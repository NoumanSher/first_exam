# QuickBooks AI Chat Integration - Debugging Challenge

## Overview
This test evaluates your ability to fix broken code through reasoning and problem-solving. You'll be working with a broken Next.js application that integrates an AI chat interface with QuickBooks API. Your task is to identify and fix the issues to get the application working properly.

## Prerequisites
- Download and install [Cursor AI IDE](https://cursor.sh/) before beginning the challenge
- You may use any AI resources available to assist you (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with Next.js, TypeScript, and API integrations

## The Challenge
You've been provided with a repository for a QuickBooks AI Chat application. The application should:
1. Allow users to connect to their QuickBooks account
2. Provide a chat interface where users can ask about their financial data
3. Retrieve and display invoice information from QuickBooks through the chat

However, the code contains several bugs, implementation errors, and incomplete sections that prevent it from functioning properly.

## Your Task
1. Clone the repository and explore the codebase
2. Identify issues preventing the application from working correctly
3. Fix the broken components, API integrations, and logic errors
4. Test your solutions to ensure the application functions as intended
5. Document the issues you found and how you fixed them

## Tips for Working Effectively

### Collaborate Effectively with AI
- **Walk the AI through your plan** and reasoning. Explain what you're trying to accomplish and your thought process as you analyze issues.
- **Show your reasoning** step-by-step to help the AI understand your context and provide more targeted assistance.
- **Ask the AI to validate your approach** before implementing complex fixes.

### Documentation Context
- **Provide library documentation** to your AI tools. Share relevant sections of the QuickBooks API docs, Next.js docs, or other library documentation directly with Claude/ChatGPT to help them give you more accurate assistance.
- **Copy and paste error messages** directly to your AI assistant for faster debugging help.

### Additional Tips
- **Use Cursor's code chat feature** to ask questions about specific sections of code without having to copy/paste everything.
- **Break down complex problems** into smaller, focused issues when working with AI tools to get more precise solutions.
- **Leverage AI for pattern recognition** by showing it working examples of similar functionality from other parts of the codebase.

## Key Files to Examine
- Type definitions
- QuickBooks API service implementation
- AI integration service
- Chat interface component
- OAuth flow implementation
- Main page component

## Evaluation Criteria
- Problem identification: How effectively you locate the issues
- Solution quality: The correctness and efficiency of your fixes
- Reasoning process: Your approach to analyzing and solving problems
- Tool usage: How effectively you leverage AI tools to assist your debugging
- Documentation: Clear explanation of the issues found and solutions implemented

## Time Limit
You have 1 hour to identify and fix as many issues as possible.

Remember, this is not just about fixing codeâ€”it's about demonstrating your problem-solving process and ability to effectively use AI tools to assist your work.

Good luck!
